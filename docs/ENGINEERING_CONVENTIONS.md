# Engineering Conventions

## Boundaries

- `src/server/services`: business logic, transactions, DB reads/writes, and
  domain invariants.
- `src/server/adapters`: external providers and SDKs. Initialize SDK clients
  lazily inside getter functions.
- `src/server/api/routers` and `src/app/api`: I/O boundaries. Validate input,
  call services, and return standardized JSON.
- `src/lib`: pure reusable utilities with no request state or provider clients.
- `src/components/ui`: reusable visual primitives and state surfaces.
- Route `_components`: page-specific UI that should not leak across routes until
  it has at least two consumers.

## UI State

- Use shared empty/error/loading state components before building ad-hoc panels.
- Use `StatusMessage` for form, mutation, and tool-call feedback instead of
  one-off red/green paragraphs.
- Use `LoadingState` for inline loading feedback instead of loose spinner/text
  pairs.
- Use `TableEmptyRow` for empty table bodies before creating route-local empty
  rows.
- Empty states must include one clear next action when a user can recover.
- Product media should use stable aspect ratios and explicit `sizes`.
- Popups, sheets, dialogs, menus, selects, tooltips, commands, and hover cards
  must use opaque popup surfaces.
- Focus states must remain visible on links, icon buttons, filter chips, and
  mobile navigation.

## Commerce Labels

- Use `formatPrice` from `src/lib/format.ts`.
- Use commerce label helpers for order status, fulfillment method, stock count,
  product availability, and filter/result counts.
- Do not render raw enum values in user-facing customer/admin surfaces unless
  the enum is intentionally operational text.

## API Responses

- Preserve public response shapes, but use shared response helpers for status,
  errors, and rate limits.
- Rate-limited responses should include `Retry-After`.
- Development fallbacks should fail clearly in production and remain documented
  in health checks.

## QA Commands

- `pnpm check`: lint, typecheck, and unit/integration tests.
- `pnpm build`: production build and environment validation.
- `pnpm smoke`: HTTP smoke check against `SMOKE_BASE_URL`.
- `pnpm e2e`: Playwright desktop and mobile flows. The local suite runs with a
  single worker to avoid shared dev-server and browser-state flakiness.
- `pnpm visual:qa`: agent-browser visual and overlay check for core routes.
- `pnpm format:check`: formatting drift check.
